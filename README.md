# About i18nbrew

i18nbrew is an experimental fork of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh),
[internationalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)
to make it ready to translate into any human language.

I track the [official Homebrew code](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/) by
occasionally merging it into i18nbrew, making adjustments, and adding new
translation keys as I spot them.  Please see the file [README.i18n.md](README.i18n.md)
for more details.

I'm still experimenting with this.  Occasionally I may work out a better way to do
things, and even more occasionally I may force-update the master branch.
Having said that, I _am_
[dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) i18nbrew
full-time on my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.5, and it's working just swimmingly.

If you want to help with translation, simply join the [LocaleApp "i18nbrew"
project](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/7650).  If you have suggestions or
patches, please submit them through the usual GitHub idioms (issues and pull
requests).  If you have bigger ideas, questions, or concerns, you may telephone
me at [+1 858 866 8276](tel:+1-858-866-8276), or toll-free in the United states
at [1-844-L2G-GEEK](tel:+1-844-524-4335).  Email works too, of course, but
because I get so bloody much email, telephoning me is the best way to get my
attention.

The original README for Homebrew is included below.
